Toy implementation of a couple of maze solving algorithms in ruby.

Actual code found under the lib directory.

Run sample_maze_solving.rb from the root directory to get a demonstration run of the search algorithms through a simple sample maze

```sh
ruby sample_maze_solving.rb
```

To run tests move to the test directory and run sample_maze_solving.rb from there.

```sh
cd test
ruby maze_solving_test.rb
```
